# The end Academy

In this web development where we not use simply HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT or we have a more advanced alternative where we use PUG, STYLUS, GULP among other things.

## Installation Advanced Developers

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)

- [PUG](https://pugjs.org/)

### Manual Setup

Then open the folder app in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd app
